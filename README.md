# Formula-1 Race Outcomes: Analysis and Predictions

This project focuses on collecting and analyzing Formula 1 race data to build a predictive model capable of forecasting future race outcomes. Using techniques such as web scraping, data mining, and machine learning methods like regression, clustering, and gradient descent, we aimed to generate accurate race predictions.

Our approach leverages data mining to extract valuable insights and predictions from large, complex datasets. By applying this methodology to Formula 1 racing, we utilized extensive historical race data to develop a model that predicts future outcomes with high accuracy. By combining state-of-the-art data mining techniques with domain expertise, this project seeks to contribute to the ongoing innovation and advancement in the world of Formula 1 racing.
